When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example \"H2SO4\" for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version \"H2O4S.\"",

The geographical distributions and rates of spread have varied considerably. P. vivax has developed resistance rapidly to sulfadoxine -pyrimethamine in many areas. Chloroquine resistance is confined largely to Indonesia, East Timor, Papua New Guinea and other parts of Oceania. There are also documented reports from Peru. P. vivax remains sensitive to chloroquine in South-East Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Korean peninsula, the Middle East, north-east Africa, and most of South and Central America.",

If 500 mg of chloroquine is administered once weekly, peak plasma concn of the drug reportedly range from 0.15-0.25 ug/mL and trough plasma concn reportedly range from 0.02-0.04 ug/mL. Results of one study indicate that chloroquine may exhibit nonlinear dose dependent pharmacokinetics. In this study, administration of a single 500 mg oral dose of chloroquine resulted in a peak serum concentration of 0.12 ug/mL, and administration of a single 1 g oral dose of the drug resulted in a peak serum concentration of 0.34 ug/mL.",

The raised pH in endosomes, prevent virus particles from utilizing their activity for fusion and entry into the cell.  Chloroquine does not affect the level of ACE2 expression on cell surfaces, but inhibits terminal glycosylation of ACE2, the receptor that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 target for cell entry. ACE2 that is not in the glycosylated state may less efficiently interact with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, further inhibiting viral entry.",

In addition, studies using chloroquine indicate that the drug apparently concentrates in parasite digestive vacuoles, increases the pH of the vacuoles, and interferes with the parasite's ability to metabolize and utilize erythrocyte hemoglobin. Plasmodial forms that do not have digestive vacuoles and do not utilize hemoglobin, such as exoerythrocytic forms, are not affected by chloroquine.",

Very slightly soluble in water, soluble in chloroform, ether and dilute acids. Chloroquine diphosphate is a white, bitter, crystalline powder. Chloroquine sulfate is a white, odorless, bitter, crystalline powder.  Hydroxychloride chloroquine is a colorless liquid. Uses: Indications: Malaria: Chloroquine is the drug of choice for the prophylaxis and treatment of malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax. P. ovale, P. malariae and sensitive P. falciparum. Amebiasis: Chloroquine is used for the treatment of extraintestinal amebiasis (usually in combination with amebicides). Treatment of discoid lupus erythematosis and rheumatoid arthritis (acute and chronic).  Chloroquine may be used for the treatment of these conditions. Other less common indications are: amebic liver abscess, porphyria cutanea tarda, solar urticaria, chronic cutaneous vasculitis. HUMAN EXPOSURE: Main risks and target organs: The main toxic effects of chloroquine are related to its quinidine-like (membrane stabilizing) actions on the heart.  Other acute effects are respiratory depression and severe gastro-intestinal irritation. Summary of clinical effects: Toxic manifestations appear rapidly within one to three hours after ingestion and include: Cardiac disturbances: circulatory arrest, shock, conduction disturbances, ventricular arrhythmias. Neurological symptoms: drowsiness, coma and sometimes convulsions.  Visual disturbances not uncommon. Respiratory symptoms: apnea. Gastrointestinal symptoms: severe gastrointestinal irritation; nausea, vomiting, cramps, diarrhea. Children are specially sensitive to toxic effects. Dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, drowsiness, blurred vision, diplopia, blindness, convulsions, coma, hypotension, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest and impaired respiration are the characteristic  features of chloroquine poisoning. Electrocardiography (ECG) may show decrease of T wave, widening of QRS, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Hypokalemia is associated with severe poisoning. Contraindications: Hepatic and renal function impairment, blood disorders, gastrointestinal illnesses, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency, severe neurological disorders, retinal or visual field changes. Chloroquine should not be used in association with gold salts or phenylbutazone. Routes of entry:  Oral: Oral absorption is the most frequent cause of intoxication. Parenteral: Intoxication after parenteral administration is rare.  A fatal outcome reported was after 250 mg IV chloroquine in a 42-year-old man. Absorption by route of exposure: Readily and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  Bioavailability is 89% for tablets.  Peak plasma concentration is reached 1.5 to 3 hours after ingestion. Distribution by route of exposure: Protein binding: 5O to 65%. Chloroquine accumulates in high concentrations in kidney, liver, lung and spleen, and is strongly bound in melanin-containing cells (eye and skin).  Red cell concentration is five to ten times the plasma concentration.  Very low concentrations  are found in the intestinal wall.  Crosses the placenta. Biological half-life by route of exposure: Plasma terminal half-life is mean 278 hours or 70 to 120 hours.  Shorter plasma elimination half-lives have been reported in children: 75 to 136 hours. Metabolism: Chloroquine undergoes metabolism by hepatic mechanisms.  The main active metabolite is desethylchloroquine.  Plasma half-life of desethylchloroquine is similar to chloroquine. Elimination by route of exposure: Chloroquine is eliminated very slowly.  About 55% is excreted in urine and 19% in feces within 77 days following therapy with 310 mg for 14 days.  Kidney: in urine about 70% is unchanged chloroquine and 23% is desethylchloroquine. It is excreted in breast milk. Toxicodynamics: The cardiotoxicity of chloroquine is related to it quinidine-like (membrane/stabilizing) effects.  Chloroquine has a negative inotropic action, inhibits spontaneous diastolic depolarization, slows conduction, lengthens the effective refractory period and raises the electrical threshold.  This results in depression of contractility, impairment of conductivity, decrease of excitability, but with possible abnormal stimulus re-entry mechanism. Hypokalemia: Acute hypokalemia may occur in acute poisoning.  It is probably related to intracellular transport of potassium by a direct effect on cellular membrane permeability. Neurological symptoms:  Neurological symptoms in acute overdose may be related to a direct toxic effect on CNS or to cerebral ischemia due to circulatory failure or respiratory insufficiency. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect is not known. Toxicity: Human data: Chloroquine has a low margin of safety; the therapeutic, toxic and lethal doses are very close. Fatalities have been reported in children after chloroquine overdoses. Interactions: Chloroquine toxicity may be increased by all drugs with  quinidine-like effects.  Combination with hepatotoxic or dermatitis-causing medication should be avoided, as well as with heparin (risk of hemorrhage) and penicillamine. Eye: Keratopathy and retinopathy may occur when large doses of chloroquine are used for long periods.  Changes occurring in the cornea are usually completely reversible on discontinuing treatment; changes in the retina, pigmentary degeneration of the retina, loss of vision, scotomas, optic nerve atrophy, field defects and blindness are irreversible.  Retinopathy is considered to occur when the total cumulative dose ingested exceeds 100 g.  Blurring of vision, diplopia may occur with short-term chloroquine therapy and are reversible. ANIMAL/PLANT STUDIES: The following progression of ECG changes was observed in dogs with experimental overdosage: severe tachycardia preceded by loss of voltage and widening of QRS, followed by sinus bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and finally asystole.",

ECG should be monitored. Because of the importance of supporting respiration, early endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Early gastric lavage may provide some benefit in reducing absorption of the drugs, but generally should be preceded by measures to correct severe cardiovascular disturbances, if present, and by respiratory support that includes endotracheal intubation with cuff inflated and in place to prevent aspiration (since seizures may occur). IV diazepam may control seizures and other manifestations of cerebral stimulation and, possibly, may prevent or minimize other toxic effects (eg, cardiotoxicity, including ECG abnormalities and conduction disturbances) of 4-aminoquinoline derivatives. However, additional study and experience are necessary to further establish the effects of diazepam on noncerebral manifestations of toxicity with these drugs. If seizures are caused by anoxia, anoxia should be corrected with oxygen and respiratory support. Equipment and facilities for cardioversion and for insertion of a transvenous pacemaker should be readily available. Administration of IV fluids and placement of the patient in Trendelenburg's position may be useful in managing hypotension, but more aggressive therapy, including administration of vasopressors (eg, epinephrine, isoproterenol, dopamine), may be necessary, particularly if shock appears to be impending. Administration of activated charcoal by stomach tube, after lavage and within 30 min after ingestion of 4-aminoquinoline derivatives, may inhibit further intestinal absorption of the drugs; the dose of activated charcoal should be at least 5 times the estimated dose of chloroquine... ingested. Peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, and hemoperfusion do not appear to be useful in the management of overdosage with 4-aminoquinoline derivatives. Patients who survive the acute phase of overdosage and are asymptomatic should be closely observed for at least 48-96 hr after ingestion",

It included 386 patients; of these, 60 who had taken drugs other than chloroquine, and 17 who had ingested less than 1 g of the drug, were excluded. The remaining 309 patients were allocated to two groups: a control group, consisting of the patients admitted between January 1973 and April 1980 (n = 146), and a diazepam group, made up of those admitted from May 1980 to December 1989 (n = 163). The patients in the latter group had had the same symptomatic treatment as those in the control group, and had been routinely given a 0.5 mg/kg bolus of diazepam on admission followed by 0.1 mg/kg/day for every 100 mg of chloroquine supposed to have been ingested. Both groups were divided into three subgroups, those patients with cardiorespiratory arrest, and those with, and those without, symptoms on admission. No statistically significant difference was found between either the control and diazepam groups or between subgroups, concerning the distribution of age, sex, amount of chloroquine supposed to have been ingested, delay in hospital admission and death rate. However, there was a higher death rate in the asymptomatic subgroup not treated with diazepam than in the diazepam group. Therefore, the routine use of diazepam for the treatment of acute chloroquine poisoning does not seem to be justified in symptomatic cases and in those with inaugural cardiac arrest.",

Patients excluded were those who had ingested more than one drug or who had major symptoms on admission (systolic blood pressure less than 80 mmHg; QRS greater than 0.12 s; cardiac dysrhythmias, respiratory disturbances). Arterial blood gases were measured on admission (T0) and 15 min after 0.5 mg/kg of diazepam had been given (T1). Gastric lavage was carried out as soon as the results of the blood gases had been obtained, and after treatment of hypoxemia (PaO2 < 90 mmHg). An infusion of diazepam (1 mg/kg/day) was then given. Arterial blood gases were measured after 1 (T2), 6 (T3), 12 (T4) and 24 hr (T5). Hypoxemia was present on admission in four patients who had a PaO2 = 75 + or - 10 mmHg (Pa(sys) = 130 + or - 19 mmHg; blood chloroquine concn = 8.2 + or - 5.2 umol/L; kaliemia /serum potassium/ = 3.1 + or - 0.3 mmol/L; PaCO2 = 35 + or - 1 mmHg). In two patients, hypoxemia decreased after the initial dose of diazepam (T1); however, oxygen was still required by the other two at that time. Oxygen was no longer needed by any patient at T2, as all the blood gas values had returned to normal.",

Quinine, the oldest antimalarial, has been used for 300 yr. Of the 200 to 300 compounds synthesized since the first synthetic antimalarial, primaquine in 1926, 15 to 20 are currently used for malaria treatment, most of which are quinoline derivatives. Quinoline derivatives, particularly quinine and chloroquine, are highly toxic in overdose. The toxic effects are related to their quinidine-like actions on the heart and include circulatory arrest, cardiogenic shock, conduction disturbances and ventricular arrhythmias. Additional clinical features are obnubilation, coma, convulsions, respiratory depression. Blindness is a frequent complication in quinine overdose. Hypokalaemia is consistently present, although apparently self-correcting, in severe chloroquine poisoning and is a good index of severity. Recent toxicokinetic studies of quinine and chloroquine showed good correlations between dose ingested, serum concn and clinical features, and confirmed the inefficacy of hemodialysis, hemoperfusion and peritoneal dialysis for enhancing drug removal. The other quinoline derivatives appear to be less toxic. Amodiaquine may induce side effects such as gastrointestinal symptoms, agranulocytosis and hepatitis. The main feature of primaquine overdose is methemoglobinemia. No cases of mefloquine and piperaquine overdose have been reported. Overdose with quinacrine, an acridine derivative, may result in nausea, vomiting, confusion, convulsion and acute psychosis. The dehydrofolate reductase inhibitors used in malaria treatment are sulfadoxine, dapsone, proguanil (chloroguanide), trimethoprim and pyrimethamine. Most of these drugs are given in combination. Proguanil is one of the safest antimalarials. Convulsion, coma and blindness have been reported in pyrimethamine overdose. Sulfadoxine can induce Lyell and Stevens-Johnson syndromes. The main feature of dapsone poisoning is severe methemoglobinemia which is related to dapsone and to its metabolites. Recent toxicokinetic studies confirmed the efficacy of oral activated charcoal, hemodialysis and hemoperfusion in enhancing removal of dapsone and its metabolites. No overdose has been reported with artemesinine, a new antimalarial tested in the People's Republic of China. The general management of antimalarial overdose include gastric lavage and symptomatic treatment.",

The earliest ophthalmoscopic sign of ... retinopathy is loss of the foveal reflex. This is followed by pigmentary changes in the macula, typically progressing to a pigmented ring surrounding the fovea (\"bull's eye lesion\") and sometimes accompanied by pigment flecks in the midperiphery. ... The most common complaint is difficulty in reading, which with further questioning can be usually related to paracentral scotomas. Light flashes and streaks and other entopic phenomena may also be present."

Blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate were not affected by chloroquine administration, remaining around 128 mmHg and 2.4 mL/min, respectively throughout the 5 hr post-equilibration period. Chloroquine produced an increase in Na+ and Cl- excretion without affecting the urine flow. By 1 hr after the start of treatment (0.03 ug chloroquine/min) the Na+ excretion rate had increased to 14.5 + or - 2.1 umol/min (n = 6), and was significantly (P < 0.01) greater than in control animals (8.6 + or - 1.0 umol/min) at the corresponding time. Parallel but lesser increases in Cl- excretion rates were also observed. The plasma aldosterone and corticosterone levels following either 10, 30 or 120 min infusion of chloroquine at 0.03 ug/min did not differ statistically from each other or from control values. It is concluded that acute chloroquine administration induces an increase in Na+ excretion. The mechanism of this natriuresis cannot be established from the present study, but is likely to involve altered tubular handling of Na+.",

When chloroquine and primaquine were given in combination, the tumor incidence increased to 23.5%. Chloroquine feeding resulted in tumors located in the liver (lymphosarcomas) and primaquine in tumors in the kidney (histiocytic sarcomas). Toads fed chloroquine plus primaquine developed tumors in the liver, kidney, lung, and urinary bladder, and all the tumors were diagnosed as histiocytic sarcomas. It is speculated that one or more metabolites of chloroquine and primaquine (eg, quinone) may be responsible for tumor induction in the toads.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",
