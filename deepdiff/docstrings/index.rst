*******
Modules
*******

The DeepDiff library includes the following modules:

- **DeepDiff** For Deep Difference of 2 objects. :doc:`/diff`

    It returns the deep difference of python objects. It can also be used to take the distance between objects. :doc:`/deep_distance`

- **DeepSearch** Search for objects within other objects. :doc:`/dsearch`

- **DeepHash** Hash any object based on their content even if they are not "hashable" in Python's eyes.  :doc:`/deephash`

- **Delta** Delta of objects that can be applied to other objects. Imagine git commits but for structured data.  :doc:`/delta`

- **Extract** For extracting a path from an object  :doc:`/extract`

- **Commandline** Most of the above functionality is also available via the commandline module  :doc:`/commandline`

What Is New
***********

DeepDiff 9-0-0
--------------

   - migration note:
        - `to_dict()` and `to_json()` now accept a `verbose_level` parameter and always return a usable text-view dict. When the original view is `'tree'`, they default to `verbose_level=2` for full detail. The old `view_override` parameter is removed. To get the previous results, you will need to pass the explicit verbose_level to `to_json` and `to_dict` if you are using the tree view.
   - Dropping support for Python 3.9
   - Support for python 3.14
   - Added support for callable ``group_by`` thanks to `echan5 <https://github.com/echan5>`__
   - Added ``FlatDeltaDict`` TypedDict for ``to_flat_dicts`` return type
   - Fixed colored view display when all list items are removed thanks to `yannrouillard <https://github.com/yannrouillard>`__
   - Fixed ``hasattr()`` swallowing ``AttributeError`` in ``__slots__`` handling for objects with ``__getattr__`` thanks to `tpvasconcelos <https://github.com/tpvasconcelos>`__
   - Fixed ``ignore_order=True`` missing int-vs-float type changes
   - Fixed Delta producing phantom entries when items both move and change values with ``iterable_compare_func`` thanks to `devin13cox <https://github.com/devin13cox>`__
   - Fixed ``_convert_oversized_ints`` failing on NamedTuples
   - Fixed orjson ``TypeError`` for integers exceeding 64-bit range
   - Fixed parameter bug in ``to_flat_dicts`` where ``include_action_in_path`` and ``report_type_changes`` were not being passed through
   - Fixed ``ignore_keys`` issue in ``detailed__dict__`` thanks to `vitalis89 <https://github.com/vitalis89>`__
   - Fixed logarithmic similarity type hint thanks to `ljames8 <https://github.com/ljames8>`__
   - Added ``Fraction`` numeric support thanks to `akshat62 <https://github.com/akshat62>`__

************
Installation
************

Install from PyPi::

    pip install deepdiff

If you want to use DeepDiff from commandline::

    pip install "deepdiff[cli]"

If you want to improve the performance of DeepDiff with certain processes such as json serialization::

    pip install "deepdiff[optimize]"

Read about DeepDiff optimizations at :ref:`optimizations_label`

Importing
---------

.. code:: python

    >>> from deepdiff import DeepDiff  # For Deep Difference of 2 objects
    >>> from deepdiff import grep, DeepSearch  # For finding if item exists in an object
    >>> from deepdiff import DeepHash  # For hashing objects based on their contents
    >>> from deepdiff import Delta  # For creating delta of objects that can be applied later to other objects.
    >>> from deepdiff import extract  # For extracting a path from an object


.. note::
    if you want to use DeepDiff via commandline, make sure to run::

        pip install "deepdiff[cli]"

Then you can access the commands via:

- DeepDiff

.. code:: bash

    $ deep diff --help

- Delta

.. code:: bash

    $ deep patch --help

- grep

.. code:: bash

    $ deep grep --help

- extract

.. code:: bash

    $ deep extract --help


Supported data types
--------------------

int, string, unicode, dictionary, list, tuple, set, frozenset, OrderedDict, NamedTuple, Numpy, custom objects and more!
