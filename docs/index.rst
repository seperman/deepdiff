DeepDiff 8.6.0 documentation!
=============================

*******
Modules
*******

The DeepDiff library includes the following modules:

- **DeepDiff** For Deep Difference of 2 objects. :doc:`/diff`

    It return the deep Difference of python objects. It can also be used to take the distance between objects. :doc:`/deep_distance`

- **DeepSearch** Search for objects within other objects. :doc:`/dsearch`

- **DeepHash** Hash any object based on their content even if they are not "hashable" in Python's eyes.  :doc:`/deephash`

- **Delta** Delta of objects that can be applied to other objects. Imagine git commits but for structured data.  :doc:`/delta`

- **Extract** For extracting a path from an object  :doc:`/extract`

- **Commandline** Most of the above functionality is also available via the commandline module  :doc:`/commandline`

What Is New

DeepDiff 8-5-0
--------------

    - Updating deprecated pydantic calls
    - Switching to pyproject.toml
    - Fix for moving nested tables when using iterable_compare_func.  by 
    - Fix recursion depth limit when hashing numpy.datetime64
    - Moving from legacy setuptools use to pyproject.toml


DeepDiff 8-4-2
--------------

    - fixes the type hints for the base
    - fixes summarize so if json dumps fails, we can still get a repr of the results
    - adds ipaddress support

************
Installation
************

Install from PyPi::

    pip install deepdiff

If you want to use DeepDiff from commandline::

    pip install "deepdiff[cli]"

If you want to improve the performance of DeepDiff with certain processes such as json serialization::

    pip install "deepdiff[optimize]"

Read about DeepDiff optimizations at :ref:`optimizations_label`

Importing
~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    >>> from deepdiff import DeepDiff  # For Deep Difference of 2 objects
    >>> from deepdiff import grep, DeepSearch  # For finding if item exists in an object
    >>> from deepdiff import DeepHash  # For hashing objects based on their contents
    >>> from deepdiff import Delta  # For creating delta of objects that can be applied later to other objects.
    >>> from deepdiff import extract  # For extracting a path from an object


.. note:: if you want to use DeepDiff via commandline, make sure to run:: 
    pip install "deepdiff[cli]"

Then you can access the commands via:

- DeepDiff

.. code:: bash

    $ deep diff --help

- Delta

.. code:: bash

    $ deep patch --help

- grep

.. code:: bash

    $ deep grep --help
- extract

.. code:: bash

    $ deep extract --help
